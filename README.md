Welcome to Quake $2!

To install my mod you just need the mod folder which comes with its own shortcut to automatically launch my mod. Everything necessary is included in there.

Controls are the same as usual game except 'F11' is used as the buy/informational window instead of the help menu.

Killing enemies rewards you with $100 and refills a little ammo for the weapon you used so don't miss!

The game is also set into waves so every 17 kills rewards you with $100 multiplied by the wave you just reached.

The main weapons of focus in the game is Blaster, Shotgun, and Machinegun.
To Buy one of these weapons you can type 'buy *insert weapon name*' into the console if you have enouogh money.
To Upgrade one of these weapons you can type 'upgrade *insert weapon name*' into the console if you have enough money.
There are 3 upgrades per weapon, 2x damage, either recoil reduction or extra projectiles, and 4x damage.

The buy menu describes the upgrades you can get as well as how many you have for each weapon.
It also tells you how many total kills you have, what wave you are on, and how many kills you need until the next wave.

The money and upgrades don't travel through levels so find a level you think would be fun and see how long you can go!
